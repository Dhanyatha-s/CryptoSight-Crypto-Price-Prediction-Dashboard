## üìà Project Overview

CryptoSight is a real-time cryptocurrency price prediction dashboard using machine learning and financial data visualizations.

---
## üìä Crypto Market Intelligence Dashboard  CryptoShight ‚Äî Streamlit + Snowflake + Python
Developed an interactive cryptocurrency market dashboard that provides real-time insights into asset performance, market volatility, liquidity, and trend analysis using Python, Streamlit, and SQL (Snowflake/MySQL). The dashboard visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs), charts, and advanced analytics to assist traders, analysts, and decision-makers.

## üß† Features

- üîÆ Crypto price prediction using ML models
- üìä Streamlit-based interactive dashboard
- üßæ Live price tracking and plotting
- üõ†Ô∏è Modular and scalable project structure

In this project if you ever come across with this or if you are new to machine learning you find it as trail and error project. why!! because all i did is here is like trail and get error and fix error and get error again, then fix it.  
So, i took a crypto currency website got it api and too 100s of data (i know its minimum & not enough to predict anything) but the workflow is what im talking i got to explore snowflake to store the data init and how i get to connect it with using python and sqlAlchemy its fantastic. there created connection, database, tables, that was smooth. once i got everything ready start to build the model using machine learning STAR Scikit-learn, started off with linear regression then understood this is not the right model for me to work on this kind of data (data: Non linear data, & its a cryptocurrency market data object, returned by an API like CoinGecko) so decided to work on RandomForestRegression and XGBoost as our data too small, i faced alot of trails with both the model had to get the MEA Low as its keep getting high value, so slaced it and augmented it, later got good accuracy but i know you know its not good why predction models need atleast data range from 1000 - 5000 for bare minimum accuracy even for demo. 
  
So, Its Just a Warmup Project where we can actually learn alogorithms and finacials metrics too.

Here is the demo
